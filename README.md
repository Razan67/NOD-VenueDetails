# 🏠 NOD Venue Details - React Native Assessment

## **Overview**
This project is a **focused React Native screen** built as part of a technical assessment for the **NOD app**.  
It demonstrates a **Venue Details screen** for the **Discover tab**, following the user story:

> As a NOD user, when I am on the Discover screen and venues appear, I want to tap on a venue and view its details so that I can decide whether to engage or make a booking.

The screen includes:
- **Venue image** (expandable on press)  
- **Venue name** and **rating badge**  
- **Location and distance**  
- **About section**  
- **Opening hours** and **phone number**  
- **Amenities tags**  
- **Book Now button**  

> The project uses **mock data** and focuses on **UI, layout, and interactions**, not full backend functionality.
